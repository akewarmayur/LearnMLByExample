### Machine Learning Algorithms
#### Decision Tree
Decision Tree is a powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the dataset based on feature conditions, creating a tree-like structure that facilitates decision-making.

#### K-means
K-means is a popular clustering algorithm used for grouping similar data points together. It partitions the data into 'k' clusters based on the mean values of features, enabling the discovery of underlying patterns within the data.

#### K Nearest Neighbour
K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) is a versatile algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It classifies data points based on the majority class among their 'k' nearest neighbors, making it a simple yet effective algorithm.

#### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm for predicting numerical values. It models the relationship between independent and dependent variables using a linear equation, making it suitable for understanding and forecasting trends.

#### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is widely used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class and is especially useful when dealing with linearly separable data.

#### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm used for classification tasks. It applies Bayes' theorem with an assumption of independence among features, making it efficient and particularly effective for text classification tasks.

#### Simple Neural Network
A Simple Neural Network serves as an introduction to the basics of neural networks. Comprising input, hidden, and output layers, it demonstrates the foundational concepts of artificial neural networks, paving the way for more complex architectures.
